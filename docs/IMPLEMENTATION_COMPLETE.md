# Implementation Complete - Grid & Effects Fixes
**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** ✅ CORE FIXES APPLIED

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Grid Bounds Auto-Detection ✅
**File:** `ui/OpenRGB3DSpatialTab_EffectStackRender.cpp` (lines 40-121)

**Change:** Grid bounds now calculated from actual LED positions instead of arbitrary user settings.

**Before:**
```cpp
grid_min_x = -half_x;  // Based on custom_grid_x setting
```

**After:**
```cpp
// Scan ALL LEDs to find actual room bounds
for each controller:
    for each LED:
        Update min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z
```

**Result:** Grid represents your actual room dimensions automatically.

---

### 2. Removed Grid Bounds Culling ✅
**File:** `ui/OpenRGB3DSpatialTab_EffectStackRender.cpp`

**Locations:**
- Virtual controllers (lines 173-176) - REMOVED
- Regular controllers (lines 342-346) - REMOVED

**Before:**
```cpp
if(x >= grid_min_x && x <= grid_max_x && ...)
{
    // Only render effect if LED within bounds
}
```

**After:**
```cpp
// ALL LEDs render effects regardless of position
```

**Result:** No more black LEDs from being "out of bounds".

---

### 3. Fixed Wipe3D Effect ✅
**Files:**
- `Effects3D/Wipe3D/Wipe3D.h` (line 45)
- `Effects3D/Wipe3D/Wipe3D.cpp` (lines 237-344)

**Change:** Added `CalculateColorGrid()` override that normalizes positions using grid bounds.

**Before:**
```cpp
position = (position + 100.0f) / 200.0f;  // Hardcoded -100 to +100!
```

**After:**
```cpp
switch(effect_axis)
{
    case AXIS_X:
        position = (x - grid.min_x) / grid.width;  // Normalize to 0-1
        break;
    // ... other axes normalized to room dimensions
}
```

**Result:** Wipe travels smoothly across entire room regardless of size.

---

### 4. Fixed Wave3D Effect ✅
**Files:**
- `Effects3D/Wave3D/Wave3D.h` (line 52)
- `Effects3D/Wave3D/Wave3D.cpp` (lines 256-382)

**Change:** Added `CalculateColorGrid()` override that normalizes positions AND scales by room size.

**Before:**
```cpp
wave_value = sin(position * freq_scale - progress);  // Raw mm coordinates!
```

**After:**
```cpp
normalized_position = (x - grid.min_x) / grid.width;  // 0-1 range
spatial_scale = (grid.width + grid.height + grid.depth) / 3.0f;  // Room size
wave_value = sin(normalized_position * freq_scale * spatial_scale * 0.01f - progress);
```

**Result:** Wave density consistent across any room size.

## Remaining Effects (Need Same Pattern)

These effects should be updated with the same pattern as Wipe3D and Wave3D:

### High Priority (Similar to Wave/Wipe)
1. **Spiral3D** - Uses radial calculations
2. **Explosion3D** - Uses distance from origin
3. **Plasma3D** - Uses spatial coordinates

### Medium Priority
4. **BreathingSphere3D** - Uses radial calculations
5. **DNAHelix3D** - Uses spatial coordinates
6. **Spin3D** - Uses angular calculations

### Low Priority
7. **DiagnosticTest3D** - Testing effect, may not need normalization

### Pattern to Apply

For each effect:

**1. Add to header (.h):**
```cpp
RGBColor CalculateColorGrid(float x, float y, float z, float time, const GridContext3D& grid) override;
```

**2. Add to implementation (.cpp):**
```cpp
RGBColor EffectName::CalculateColorGrid(float x, float y, float z, float time, const GridContext3D& grid)
{
    // Get origin
    Vector3D origin = GetEffectOrigin();
    float rel_x = x - origin.x;
    float rel_y = y - origin.y;
    float rel_z = z - origin.z;

    // Normalize coordinates
    float norm_x = (x - grid.min_x) / grid.width;
    float norm_y = (y - grid.min_y) / grid.height;
    float norm_z = (z - grid.min_z) / grid.depth;

    // Use normalized coordinates in calculations
    // ...
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Build the Plugin
```bash
cd D:\MCP\OpenRGB3DSpatialPlugin
qmake OpenRGB3DSpatialPlugin.pro
nmake  # or make on Linux/Mac
```

### Check Logs
On startup, you should see:
```
Grid bounds: X[-1834.0 to 1834.0] (3668.0mm) Y[-1211.5 to 1211.5] (2423.0mm) Z[-1361.5 to 1361.5] (2723.0mm)
```

These numbers should match your actual room dimensions based on LED positions.

### Test Wipe Effect
1. Select Wipe3D effect
2. Set Axis to X (left-right)
3. Watch wipe travel smoothly from left wall to right wall
4. Change to Y axis - should travel front to back
5. Change to Z axis - should travel floor to ceiling
6. **All LEDs should light up** - no black zones

### Test Wave Effect
1. Select Wave3D effect
2. Adjust frequency slider
3. Wave should show consistent number of cycles across room
4. Change room size (move LEDs) - wave density should adapt
5. **All LEDs should show wave pattern** - no black zones

## Known Issues / Future Work

### Remaining Effects Need Updating
The 7 other effects listed above still use the old `CalculateColor()` method without grid normalization. They will work but may not scale correctly to room size.

**Priority:** Update Spiral3D, Explosion3D, and Plasma3D next as they're most commonly used.

### Multi-Reference Point Effects (Future)
Currently effects use single origin (room center or user position). Future enhancement: effects that use multiple reference points.

**Example:** Lightning effect that travels between two points.

### Performance Optimization (If Needed)
Current implementation recalculates grid bounds every frame. If performance becomes an issue with many LEDs, could cache bounds and only recalculate when LEDs move.

**When to optimize:** Only if you notice slowdown with 500+ LEDs.
